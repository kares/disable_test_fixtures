DisableTestFixtures
===================

Rails plugin that disables fixture loading during test setup.

This is useful for those not really enjoying test fixtures and
preferring a "factory" test pattern, but without extensive database 
mocking (staying transactionaly connected in every test).


Example
=======

class UserTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase

  disable_fixtures_for :all

  test "create a user" do
    User.create! :name => 'Gregory House'
    assert_equal 1, User.count
  end

end
